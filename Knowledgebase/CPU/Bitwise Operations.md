# Bitwise Operations

Bitwise operations are fundamental operations that manipulate individual bits of data. They are commonly used in low-level programming, such as in systems programming, embedded systems, and cryptography.

## Bitwise Operators

There are several bitwise operators available in most programming languages:

- `&` (AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation on two operands.
- `|` (OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation on two operands.
- `^` (XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on two operands.
- `~` (NOT): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single operand.
- `<<` (Left Shift): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of positions.
- `>>` (Right Shift): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of positions.

## Common Use Cases

Bitwise operations are used in various scenarios, including:

- Manipulating individual bits within a data structure.
- Setting or clearing specific bits in a register or flag.
- Performing efficient arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and division by powers of 2.
- Implementing bitwise algorithms, such as bit counting and bit reversal.

## Examples

Here are some examples of bitwise operations:

1. Bitwise AND:
    - Binary numbers: 1010 & 1100
    ```  
    1010
    1100
    ----
    1000
    ```

2. Bitwise OR:
    - Binary numbers: 1010 | 1100
    ```
    1010
    1100
    ----
    1110
    ```

3. Bitwise XOR:
    - Binary numbers: 1010 ^ 1100
    - Result: 0110

4. Bitwise NOT:
    - Binary number: ~1010
    - Result: 0101

5. Left Shift:
    - Binary number: 1010 << 2
    - Result: 101000
    - Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjqswwqE1RQ

6. Right Shift:
    - Binary number: 1010 >> 2
    - Result: 0010
