# Computer Memory (Volatile Memory)

With Computer Memory we explicitly mean the data storage for immediate use in the computer, sometimes also refered to Main memory, Primary storage or RAM (Random-Access Memory). In other words, this page focuses on **Volatile Memory** and will not go into further detail on **Non-volatile Memory** or **Semi-volatile Memory** besides the following short explanation of the three:

## Volatile Memory

Volatile Memory (german translation: "flüchtiger Speicher") requires a constant supply of power to maintain stored information. Therefore upon loss of power the stored data will be quickly lost as well. Most modern semiconductor volatile memory is either **static RAM (SRAM)** or **dynamic RAM (DRAM)**

### SRAM

Static random-access memory (static RAM or SRAM) is a type of random-access memory (RAM) that uses latching circuitry (flip-flop) to store each bit.

- SRAM will hold its data permanently in the presence of power.
- SRAM is faster than DRAM but it is more expensive in terms of silicon area and cost.
- SRAM is typically used for the cache and internal registers of a CPU.

### DRAM

Dynamic random-access memory (dynamic RAM or DRAM) is a type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell, usually consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor, both typically based on metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology.

The electric charge on the capacitors gradually leaks away; without intervention the data on the capacitor would soon be lost. To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge.

- DRAM is typically used for desktop system memory.
